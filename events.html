      <h2 class="titel">EVENTS </h2>
      <p>With a serrated blend of techno, post-punk and gabber, Victoria Vassiliki Daldas and Theo Zeitner are on a mission to make everyone a little scared and excited at the same time.</p>
      <p>During an <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjeIhHewn2A&t=3s">interview</a></strong>, Brutalismus3000 expressed their unwillingness to accept additional gigs, stating that they were not interested in leading a hectic lifestyle. Their priority was to prioritize their relationship and spend quality time together. They found it amusing that they had skipped the process of starting with small gigs, having performed their very first show in front of 2000 people in Paris. By focusing on larger gigs, they didn't feel the need to constantly perform in order to maintain financial stability. The duo also commented on other DJs who performed 15-20 shows, expressing their confusion regarding how they managed such a substantial income. Victoria chimed in, stating that they would never accept a gig on Halloween, regardless of the payment offered, as it was Theo's favorite holiday. Victoria herself emphasized the significance of the day by stating that if she were to perform on Halloween, it would imply her departure and lack of personal fulfillment. Instead, she preferred to stay at home and enjoy '80s horror movies, as it held sentimental value for her.</p>
