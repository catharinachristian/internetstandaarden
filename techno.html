        <h3>Techno</h3>
        <p>
          Techno is a genre of electronic dance music <b>'EDM'</b> that is
          typically created for continuous DJ sets. The tempo of techno music
          usually ranges from 120 to 150 beats per minute (bpm), according to
          Marcello Perri. The main rhythm of techno is typically in common time
          (4/4) and is often characterized by a repetitive four on the floor
          beat. Artists in this genre use electronic instruments such as drum
          machines, sequencers, and synthesizers, as well as digital audio
          workstations. Drum machines like Roland's TR-808 and TR-909 from the
          1980s are highly valued, and software imitations of these vintage
          instruments are popular.

          In techno, the emphasis is placed on <strong>rhythm</strong> rather
          than other musical elements. Techno tracks progress primarily through
          the manipulation of timbral characteristics of synthesizer presets.
          Unlike other forms of EDM that are often created using synthesizer
          keyboards, techno does not adhere strictly to the harmonic practices
          of Western music. Instead, it often disregards traditional structures
          in favor of solely manipulating timbre. Another defining feature of
          techno music and its aesthetic is the openness to creative use of
          music production technology.

          The term <b>techno</b> was first used in Germany in the early 1980s to
          describe a type of electronic music. After the release of the
          compilation Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit in the UK in 1988,
          the term became associated with a specific subgenre of EDM produced in
          Detroit. Detroit techno emerged from the fusion of synth-pop with
          African American styles like <em>house, electro, and funk</em>. It was
          also influenced by futuristic and science-fiction themes that
          reflected contemporary American society, with Alvin Toffler's book The
          Third Wave as a notable source of inspiration. The music created in
          the mid-to-late 1980s by artists like Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and
          Kevin Saunderson (known as The Belleville Three), along with Eddie
          Fowlkes, Blake Baxter, James Pennington, and others, is considered the
          first wave of techno from Detroit.

          Following the success of house music in several European countries,
          techno gained popularity in the UK, Germany, Belgium, and the
          Netherlands. Regional variations of techno quickly developed in
          Europe, and by the early 1990s, subgenres such as
          <em>acid, hardcore, bleep, ambient, and dub techno</em> emerged. Music
          journalists and techno fans are generally careful in their use of the
          term, making a clear distinction between related but different styles,
          such as tech house and trance.

          Club drugs, also known as rave drugs or party drugs, are recreational
          drugs commonly associated with discothèques in the 1970s and
          nightclubs, dance clubs, electronic dance music (EDM) parties, and
          raves from the 1980s to the present day. Unlike certain other drug
          classifications, such as opiates and benzodiazepines, which are
          determined based on pharmaceutical or chemical characteristics, club
          drugs are considered a "convenience category." This means that drugs
          are included in this category based on the locations where they are
          consumed or the activities the user engages in while under their
          influence. Generally, club drugs are most commonly used by adolescents
          and young adults.
