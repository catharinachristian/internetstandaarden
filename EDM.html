      <h2> history</h2>
      <p>
         Electronic dance music (EDM) is a diverse range of percussive electronic music genres that initially originated for nightclubs, raves, and festivals. It is primarily created for DJs to seamlessly mix tracks together in a DJ mix, transitioning from one recording to another. EDM producers also perform their music live in concerts or festival settings, sometimes referred to as a live PA. Over time, EDM has expanded to encompass a wide variety of subgenres.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, EDM gained mainstream popularity in Europe, thanks to the rise of raving, pirate radio, PartyCrews, underground festivals, and the growing interest in club culture. However, it didn't experience the same level of popularity in the United States, remaining largely limited to regional scenes in New York City, Florida, the Midwest, and California. Despite the influence of electro and Chicago house music in both Europe and the United States, mainstream media and the record industry stubbornly opposed EDM. Additionally, there was a perceived connection between EDM and drug culture, leading state and city governments to enact laws and policies aimed at curbing the spread of rave culture. Nevertheless, in the 2000s, EDM began to gain global popularity, especially in the United States and Australia. The American music industry and music press then started promoting the term "electronic dance music" and the acronym "EDM" to reshape the perception of American rave culture. However, despite the industry's attempt to create a specific EDM brand, the abbreviation continues to be used as an umbrella term for various genres, including dance-pop, house, techno, electro, and trance, along with their respective subgenres.
