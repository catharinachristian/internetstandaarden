        <h3>Victoria Vassiliki Daldas and Theo Zeitne</h3>
        <p>
          Known for their raw and aggressive sound,
          <strong> Brutalismus 3000 </strong> is renowned for incorporating
          political themes into their music. Tracks like "No Sex With Cops" and
          "Satan Was a Babyboomer" tackle social issues, while Victoria
          Vassiliki Daldas has described her vocals in the feminist anthem "Good
          Girl." The duo gained attention for their remix of Grauzone's
          "Eisbär," infusing their unique style into the Swiss Neue Deutsche
          Welle band's single. Taking inspiration from genres like
          <em>gabber, hardcore, hardstyle, and punk</em>, Brutalismus 3000's
          music also showcases elements of electroclash and hyperpop, as noted
          by commentators. Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft and Blümchen are
          among the groups that influence their music, along with ironic
          undertones and a nod to 2000s music. With lyrics in
          <em>English, German, and Slovak</em>, the trilingualism of Daldas
          shines through in their music, laden with her fierce and commanding
          vocals.

        <p>Brutalismus 3000 is a collaborative project spearheaded by
          <strong>Victoria Vassiliki Daldas and Theo Zeitner</strong>. Their
          initial encounter was facilitated by the popular dating app, Tinder,
          where they both swiped left on each other. Their first date took place
          at a bar in Neukölln, <strong>Berlin</strong>, in the late hours of
          the night. To their pleasant surprise, they discovered a shared
          affinity for similar music tastes. Taking a trip down memory lane,
          Theo began producing music roughly a decade ago, albeit not with a
          serious intent. Initially disapproving of the minimal techno genre
          that captivated his friends, he arrogantly believed he could
          effortlessly replicate the same sound using <em>Garage Band</em> on
          his iPad. To disprove their musical preferences, he decided to
          experiment himself, only to find an unexpected allure and subsequently
          invested in professional equipment. Before this turning point, Theo's
          musical inclinations were strongly rooted in <strong>punk</strong>, a
          genre that still resonates with him today. Additionally, he divulges
          an appreciation for <em>Kanye West</em> and other rap artists,
          although their lyrical content has somewhat diminished his interest
          over time. Conversely, Victoria's musical journey involved playing the
          piano, albeit without much success, as she admits. Seeking to improve
          her academic standing, she reluctantly joined the school choir during
          her less-than-impressive academic phase. During her teenage years, she
          gravitated towards <strong>RnB</strong>, finding solace in the
          artistry of Avril Lavigne and Tupac. As a creative outlet, she also
          dabbled in writing her own lyrics. Upon relocating to Berlin, the pair
          started exploring the vibrant rave scene more actively. It didn't take
          long for their paths to intersect and discover their shared passion
          for creating music. Reflecting on their first date, music,
          particularly the influential band <em>D.A.F</em> (Deutsch
          Amerikanische Freundschaft), dominated their conversation, solidifying
          their bond. "Their groundbreaking approach to music in the 1970s was
          unparalleled. Unlike other punk bands of the time, D.A.F. stood out
          with their unique blend of intensity, speed, and aggression," Victoria
          elaborates.
