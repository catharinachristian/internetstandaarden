        <h1>Victoria Vassiliki Daldas and Theo Zeitne</h1>
        <p>Known for their raw and aggressive sound, <strong> Brutalismus 3000 </strong> is renowned for incorporating political themes into their music. Tracks like "No Sex With Cops" and "Satan Was a Babyboomer" tackle social issues, while Victoria Vassiliki Daldas has described her vocals in the feminist anthem "Good Girl." The duo gained attention for their remix of Grauzone's "Eisbär," infusing their unique style into the Swiss Neue Deutsche Welle band's single. Taking inspiration from genres like gabber, hardcore, hardstyle, and punk, Brutalismus 3000's music also showcases elements of electroclash and hyperpop, as noted by commentators. Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft and Blümchen are among the groups that influence their music, along with ironic undertones and a nod to 2000s music. With lyrics in English, German, and Slovak, the trilingualism of Daldas shines through in their music, laden with her fierce and commanding vocals.</p>

        Brutalismus 3000 is a collaborative project spearheaded by Victoria Vassiliki Daldas and Theo Zeitner. Their initial encounter was facilitated by the popular dating app, Tinder, where they both swiped left on each other. Their first date took place at a bar in Neukölln, Berlin, in the late hours of the night. To their pleasant surprise, they discovered a shared affinity for similar music tastes. Taking a trip down memory lane, Theo began producing music roughly a decade ago, albeit not with a serious intent. Initially disapproving of the minimal techno genre that captivated his friends, he arrogantly believed he could effortlessly replicate the same sound using Garage Band on his iPad. To disprove their musical preferences, he decided to experiment himself, only to find an unexpected allure and subsequently invested in professional equipment. Before this turning point, Theo's musical inclinations were strongly rooted in punk, a genre that still resonates with him today. Additionally, he divulges an appreciation for Kanye West and other rap artists, although their lyrical content has somewhat diminished his interest over time. Conversely, Victoria's musical journey involved playing the piano, albeit without much success, as she admits. Seeking to improve her academic standing, she reluctantly joined the school choir during her less-than-impressive academic phase. During her teenage years, she gravitated towards RnB, finding solace in the artistry of Avril Lavigne and Tupac. As a creative outlet, she also dabbled in writing her own lyrics. Upon relocating to Berlin, the pair started exploring the vibrant rave scene more actively. It didn't take long for their paths to intersect and discover their shared passion for creating music. Reflecting on their first date, music, particularly the influential band D.A.F (Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft), dominated their conversation, solidifying their bond. "Their groundbreaking approach to music in the 1970s was unparalleled. Unlike other punk bands of the time, D.A.F stood out with their unique blend of intensity, speed, and aggression," Victoria elaborates.</p>
