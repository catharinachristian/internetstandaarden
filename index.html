    <h1>About </h1>
    <h2>Victoria Vassiliki Daldas and Theo Zeitne</h2>
    <p>
      Known for their raw and aggressive sound, Brutalismus 3000 is renowned for incorporating political themes into their music. Tracks like "No Sex With Cops" and "Satan Was a Babyboomer" tackle social issues, while Victoria Vassiliki Daldas has described her vocals in the feminist anthem "Good Girl." The duo gained attention for their remix of Grauzone's "Eisbär," infusing their unique style into the Swiss Neue Deutsche Welle band's single. Taking inspiration from genres like gabber, hardcore, hardstyle, and punk, Brutalismus 3000's music also showcases elements of electroclash and hyperpop, as noted by commentators. Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft and Blümchen are among the groups that influence their music, along with ironic undertones and a nod to 2000s music. With lyrics in English, German, and Slovak, the trilingualism of Daldas shines through in their music, laden with her fierce and commanding vocals.
